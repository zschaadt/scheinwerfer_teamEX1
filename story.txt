A young boy named Michael was walking on Hauptstrasse, in Germany, when he heard a crash.
He jumped out of his BMW and ran passed the Baeckerei. 
There was a hund, frightened, running the opposite direction as he ran.
He decided to chase it, running as fast as his lederhose would let him.
After a wettbewerbsfaehig chase he finally caught up to the hund.
He then realized that the chase was pointless, so he decided to go and get a drink at the nearest biergarten.
Devastated by the loss of the hund in the wettbewerbsfaehig chase, Michael ordered the largest Apfelkuchen available, 
he drowned his sorrows in each bite, hoping to fill the void left by the fleeting hund.
As Michael sat and ate, his favorite brand, Rammstein, played across the speakers.
Michael whipped out his huemmelchen and started to jam along with the music.
It was hot outside, but thankfully the klimaanlage kept the biergarten cool.
He headed across the road to the Ratskellar to find where the music was coming from.
As he walked down the road, Michael spotted a little Baeckerei with freshly made Gevaeck displayed in the window.
